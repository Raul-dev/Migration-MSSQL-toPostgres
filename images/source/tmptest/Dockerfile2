STOPSIGNAL SIGINT
#
# An additional setting that is recommended for all users regardless of this
# value is the runtime "--stop-timeout" (or your orchestrator/runtime's
# equivalent) for controlling how long to wait between sending the defined
# STOPSIGNAL and sending SIGKILL (which is likely to cause data corruption).
#
# The default in most runtimes (such as Docker) is 10 seconds, and the
# documentation at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/server-start.html notes
# that even 90 seconds may not be long enough in many instances.
